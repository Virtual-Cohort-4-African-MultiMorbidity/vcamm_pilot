# vcamm_project
## Project Overview
VCAMM is a pioneering research initiative aimed at investigating the genomic and non-genomic risk factors underlying multimorbidity in African populations. This cohort is designed to be cost-effective, agile, and responsive to both existing public health concerns, such as Type 2 diabetes, and emerging diseases. The project generates African data from African participants using African tools, contributing to the development of precision medicine in resource-limited settings.

## Project Data
This repository also houses supplementary datasets, scripts, and tools related to publications derived from the VCAMM project. These resources are freely available for public use, aligning with our commitment to open science and data-sharing within the African research landscape.

## Supplementary Data for Publications
All supplementary datasets and files referenced in related VCAMM publications are stored in the supplementary_data folder.
